# See what's happening in the LAN-Cache log. This is good for checking on the
# status of a download and peer-seeding.

# This one is good for Addigy's web shell:
tail /Library/Addigy/logs/cache.log

# If you have a more responsive shell, watch the log in live time:
tail -f /Library/Addigy/logs/cache.log
